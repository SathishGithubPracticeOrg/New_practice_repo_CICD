# Defining the lambda layer install step using docker:

Ah, good question! This is where understanding the behavior of **system-level dependencies** in AWS Lambda and Lambda Layers becomes important. Let’s break it down.

---

## **System-Level Dependencies (e.g., `apt-get` and native libraries)**

1. **AWS Lambda Runtime**:
   - AWS Lambda runs in a **custom execution environment** where certain system-level libraries (like `glibc` or `libstdc++`) are already available.
   - However, if you require additional system dependencies (e.g., libraries like `libgomp1` or others installed via `apt-get`), they are **not natively supported** in the Lambda runtime.

2. **Lambda Layers and System Dependencies**:
   - System dependencies (installed via `apt-get`) **cannot** be installed at runtime directly using a `setup.sh` script during Lambda execution. Instead, they need to be prebuilt, packaged, and included in your Lambda **Layer** or **Function Deployment Package**.

3. **The Solution**:
   - Package the system libraries (e.g., using Docker or a build script) as part of a **Lambda Layer**.
   - The system libraries will reside in the `/opt` directory of the Lambda runtime environment and can be used seamlessly.

---

## **How System Dependencies Work in the Layer**

1. **Install System Dependencies During Build Time**:
   - Run the `apt-get` commands **during the build process**, not during Lambda invocation.
   - This is typically done using a Docker container (matching the Lambda runtime environment).

2. **Package System Dependencies in the Layer**:
   - After installing system dependencies, you package the required libraries into a **Lambda Layer**.

3. **Include the Layer in the Lambda Function**:
   - The layer makes the system dependencies available at `/opt/` during Lambda execution.

---

## **Example Workflow for Packaging System Dependencies**

### **1. Create a Build Script (`build-system-layer.sh`)**

This script will use a Docker container to install system dependencies and package them into a zip file.

**File: `build-system-layer.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Pull an AWS Lambda base Docker image for Python 3.9
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/lambda-build amazonlinux:2 bash -c "
    # Install dependencies
    yum update -y
    yum install -y gcc libgomp libstdc++ python3.9 zip
    
    # Create the layer folder structure
    mkdir -p /lambda-build/layer/lib
    mkdir -p /lambda-build/layer/bin

    # Copy installed libraries to the layer
    cp -v /usr/lib64/libgomp.so.* /lambda-build/layer/lib/
    cp -v /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.* /lambda-build/layer/lib/
    
    # Zip the layer content
    cd /lambda-build/layer
    zip -r /lambda-build/system-layer.zip .
"
```

### **2. Run the Build Script**

Execute the script locally to generate the `system-layer.zip` file:

```bash
chmod +x build-system-layer.sh
./build-system-layer.sh
```

After running, you will have a file `system-layer.zip` in your directory.

---

### **3. Update the Serverless YAML to Use the Layer**

Now include the `system-layer.zip` file as a layer:

```yaml
layers:
  systemDependenciesLayer:
    path: system-layer.zip     # Path to the zip file generated
    compatibleRuntimes:
      - python3.9

functions:
  s3ToSQSHandler:
    handler: handlers/s3_to_sqs.s3_to_sqs
    layers:
      - { Ref: SystemDependenciesLayerLambdaLayer }
    events:
      - s3:
          bucket: ${self:custom.bucketName}
          event: s3:ObjectCreated:*
          existing: true

  sqsProcessorHandler:
    handler: handlers/sqs_processor.sqs_processor
    layers:
      - { Ref: SystemDependenciesLayerLambdaLayer }
    events:
      - sqs:
          arn:
            Fn::GetAtt:
              - BatchProcessingQueue
              - Arn
          batchSize: 5
```

---

## **How It Works in Lambda**

1. The `system-layer.zip` file is deployed as a **Lambda Layer**.
2. At runtime, the contents of the layer are extracted into the `/opt` directory:
   - Libraries like `libgomp.so` will be available at `/opt/lib/`.
   - Any executables will be in `/opt/bin/`.

3. The Lambda function automatically includes `/opt/lib` and `/opt/bin` in its library and execution paths. This means your Lambda code can use system dependencies without running any `setup.sh` or `apt-get` commands during each invocation.

---

## **Why Avoid Running `apt-get` During Invocation?**

- **Cold Start Latency**: Installing system libraries using `apt-get` during each invocation would significantly increase the cold start time.
- **No Root Permissions**: AWS Lambda does not provide root-level permissions, so you can’t install packages dynamically at runtime.
- **Cost Inefficiency**: Running installation commands during each invocation wastes Lambda execution time and incurs unnecessary costs.

---

## **End-to-End Flow**

1. **Build Phase**:
   - Use a Docker container to preinstall system dependencies.
   - Package the libraries into a `system-layer.zip` file.

2. **Deployment**:
   - The Serverless Framework uploads the `system-layer.zip` file as a Lambda Layer.
   - Associates the layer with your Lambda function.

3. **Execution**:
   - During invocation, the Lambda runtime automatically extracts the layer to `/opt`.
   - Your system libraries are ready to use, **without re-running any setup script**.

---

## **Key Notes**

- **Layers are Immutable**: Once deployed, layers cannot be changed. To update dependencies, you need to create a new layer version.
- **Layer Size Limit**: A Lambda Layer can be up to **250 MB uncompressed**.
- **Multiple Layers**: AWS allows you to attach up to **5 layers** per Lambda function.

# Can you sum, you know, give me, since we have broken down a lot of bit by bit, bit by bit, bit by bit till now, I need the complete code. Now, what all I need? I need the first thing is CI, CD, YAML, where the lambda function, the layers creation, right? So, it includes the setup.sh, where the system libraries like Tesseract, OCR, and Poplar utils are installed along with the other like Python libraries, which is like, let us say unstructured. Okay. And then that is a CI, CD part where the deployment is happening. And then next I need the two lambda handlers function code. And then I also need the serverless YAML. YAML should include S3, whatever the details of S3 triggering the lambda function, it should also have the details of the SQS invocation and two lambda handlers and associating with these lambda layers also. Can you help me with this complete package?
---
---

Certainly! Below is the **complete package** that includes:

1. **CI/CD pipeline configuration** (e.g., GitHub Actions) to:
   - Build a Lambda Layer with system dependencies and Python libraries.
   - Package and deploy the application using the Serverless Framework.

2. **Lambda Handlers**:
   - **Handler 1**: Triggered by S3 to push messages to SQS.
   - **Handler 2**: Triggered by SQS to process messages.

3. **Serverless YAML**:
   - Configures S3, SQS, Lambda Layers, IAM roles, and the two Lambda functions.

---

## **1. CI/CD Workflow File**

This file (`.github/workflows/deploy-lambda.yml`) builds the Lambda Layer, zips it, installs dependencies (like **Tesseract OCR** and Poppler utils), and deploys the Serverless configuration.

```yaml
name: Deploy Lambda with Layer

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Install System Dependencies
      - name: Install System Libraries
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr libpoppler-utils

      # Step 3: Build Lambda Layer
      - name: Build Lambda Layer
        run: |
          mkdir -p layer/python
          pip install --target layer/python -r requirements.txt
          cd layer
          zip -r layer.zip python

      # Step 4: Deploy with Serverless Framework
      - name: Deploy Serverless Application
        uses: serverless/github-action@v3.1
        with:
          args: deploy
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_REGION: us-east-1
```

---

### **2. `setup.sh` (Optional: For local testing)**

For local testing, you can include a `setup.sh` to install dependencies:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr libpoppler-utils
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **3. Requirements File**

File: `requirements.txt`

```text
unstructured
boto3
```

---

## **4. Lambda Handlers**

### **Handler 1: `s3_to_sqs.py`**

This Lambda function is triggered when a file is uploaded to S3. It sends a message to the SQS queue.

```python
import boto3
import json
import os

sqs_client = boto3.client("sqs")

def s3_to_sqs(event, context):
    # SQS Queue URL
    queue_url = os.environ["SQS_QUEUE_URL"]

    # Extract S3 file details from the event
    for record in event["Records"]:
        bucket = record["s3"]["bucket"]["name"]
        key = record["s3"]["object"]["key"]

        message = {
            "bucket": bucket,
            "key": key
        }

        # Send message to SQS
        response = sqs_client.send_message(
            QueueUrl=queue_url,
            MessageBody=json.dumps(message)
        )

        print(f"Message sent to SQS: {response['MessageId']}")
```

---

### **Handler 2: `sqs_processor.py`**

This Lambda function processes messages from the SQS queue.

```python
import boto3
import os
from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf

s3_client = boto3.client("s3")

def sqs_processor(event, context):
    for record in event["Records"]:
        # Extract SQS message
        message = json.loads(record["body"])
        bucket = message["bucket"]
        key = message["key"]

        # Download file from S3
        local_path = f"/tmp/{os.path.basename(key)}"
        s3_client.download_file(bucket, key, local_path)
        print(f"Downloaded file: {local_path}")

        # Process file (e.g., extract text from PDF)
        elements = partition_pdf(filename=local_path)
        print("Extracted Text:")
        for element in elements:
            print(element.text)
```

---

## **5. Serverless YAML**

This file configures the resources, Lambda layers, Lambda functions, and triggers.

```yaml
service: s3-to-sqs-processing

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.9
  region: us-east-1
  iamRoleStatements:
    - Effect: Allow
      Action:
        - "sqs:SendMessage"
        - "sqs:ReceiveMessage"
        - "sqs:DeleteMessage"
        - "s3:GetObject"
      Resource: "*"

layers:
  customDependenciesLayer:
    path: layer/layer.zip
    compatibleRuntimes:
      - python3.9

functions:
  s3ToSQSHandler:
    handler: s3_to_sqs.s3_to_sqs
    layers:
      - { Ref: CustomDependenciesLayerLambdaLayer }
    environment:
      SQS_QUEUE_URL:
        Ref: BatchProcessingQueue
    events:
      - s3:
          bucket: ${self:custom.bucketName}
          event: s3:ObjectCreated:*
          existing: true

  sqsProcessorHandler:
    handler: sqs_processor.sqs_processor
    layers:
      - { Ref: CustomDependenciesLayerLambdaLayer }
    events:
      - sqs:
          arn:
            Fn::GetAtt:
              - BatchProcessingQueue
              - Arn
          batchSize: 5

resources:
  Resources:
    BatchProcessingQueue:
      Type: AWS::SQS::Queue
      Properties:
        QueueName: batch-processing-queue
        VisibilityTimeout: 60

    FileProcessingBucket:
      Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
      Properties:
        BucketName: file-processing-bucket

custom:
  bucketName: file-processing-bucket
```

## **6. Folder Structure**

Here's the directory layout for the project:

```text

## **How It Works**

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Installs system dependencies (Tesseract OCR, Poppler utils).
   - Packages Python dependencies into a Lambda layer.
   - Deploys the Serverless stack (S3 bucket, SQS queue, Lambda functions, and Lambda layer).

2. **Lambda Flow**:
   - **S3 Trigger**: When a file is uploaded to S3, `s3_to_sqs` sends a message to the SQS queue.
   - **SQS Trigger**: The `sqs_processor` Lambda processes the SQS messages, downloads the file from S3, and extracts text.

3. **Layer**:
   - All Python libraries and system dependencies are bundled into a Lambda layer, available in `/opt`.

# You are not getting it. See, for the Lambda to run the processing that file, I need to install unstructured library. So, that is why I need Lambda layers to have that unstructured library. But for the unstructured library to run, right, so the Lambda should have additional system libraries like Popular Utils and Tesseract OCR. Now, I need to have that inside the Lambda layer, or it should be part of the Lambda, it should be installed when the Lambda is being invoked. I don't know how to do it, right, whether it is that way or through the Lambda layers. That is what I mentioned in the CACD pipeline. By creating that layer, is there a way that, you know, you can create that layer itself having those system dependencies, or when we define the Lambda, we will define that, you know, it installs the system dependencies. That is what I was asking.
---
---

Got it! Now the requirement is **very clear**.

### Problem:
1. The **unstructured library** needs to run in the Lambda function.
2. For the `unstructured` library to work, you need **system libraries** like:
   - **Tesseract OCR**
   - **Poppler Utils**
3. You want to know:
   - Should these system dependencies be part of a **Lambda Layer**?
   - Or should they be installed dynamically when the Lambda runs?

---

### **Best Practice for System Libraries in Lambda**

The recommended approach is:

1. **Package the system libraries into a Lambda Layer**.
   - This keeps the Lambda deployment **small** and avoids installing dependencies dynamically every invocation.
   - Layers persist across Lambda invocations and can be reused.

2. Bundle the **Python dependencies** (like `unstructured`) in the same or a separate Lambda Layer.

---

### Solution Outline

1. Use a **Docker container** (in CI/CD pipeline) to:
   - Install the system libraries (`Tesseract OCR` and `Poppler utils`) in a compatible format for Lambda.
   - Install the Python libraries (`unstructured`, `boto3`).
   - Package everything as a **zip file** for the Lambda Layer.

2. Attach the Lambda Layer to your Lambda functions.

---

### Steps:

1. **Build Lambda Layer (with system and Python libraries)**:
   - Use Docker to create a zip file containing:
     - System dependencies (installed in `/opt/bin`, `/opt/lib`, etc.).
     - Python dependencies installed in `/opt/python`.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Use GitHub Actions to:
     - Build the Lambda Layer zip file.
     - Deploy it using Serverless Framework.

3. **Serverless YAML**:
   - Attach the created Lambda Layer to the Lambda functions.

---

### **Complete Code**

---

#### **1. Dockerfile for Building the Lambda Layer**

Create a `Dockerfile` to package system and Python dependencies:

```dockerfile
FROM amazonlinux:2

# Install system libraries
RUN yum update -y && \
    yum install -y tesseract poppler-utils tar gzip && \
    yum clean all

# Install Python and pip

    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

          container_id=$(docker create lambda-layer)
          docker cp ${container_id}:/layer.zip layer.zip
          docker rm ${container_id}

      - name: Deploy with Serverless

#### **4. Lambda Handlers**

**`s3_to_sqs.py`:**

```python
import boto3
import json
import os

sqs_client = boto3.client("sqs")

def s3_to_sqs(event, context):
    queue_url = os.environ["SQS_QUEUE_URL"]

    for record in event["Records"]:
        bucket = record["s3"]["bucket"]["name"]
        key = record["s3"]["object"]["key"]

        message = {"bucket": bucket, "key": key}
        sqs_client.send_message(QueueUrl=queue_url, MessageBody=json.dumps(message))
```

**`sqs_processor.py`:**

```python
import boto3
import os
from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf

s3_client = boto3.client("s3")

def sqs_processor(event, context):
    for record in event["Records"]:
        message = json.loads(record["body"])
        bucket = message["bucket"]
        key = message["key"]

        local_path = f"/tmp/{os.path.basename(key)}"
        s3_client.download_file(bucket, key, local_path)

        elements = partition_pdf(filename=local_path)
        for element in elements:
            print(element.text)
```

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Docker Build**:
   - Installs system libraries (`Tesseract OCR`, `Poppler`) and Python dependencies (`unstructured`).
   - Packages them into a **Lambda Layer**.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Builds the Lambda Layer zip.
   - Deploys the Serverless stack.

3. **Serverless Deployment**:
   - Creates the SQS queue, S3 bucket, Lambda functions, and attaches the Lambda Layer.

4. **Lambda Execution**:
   - The **system libraries** and Python dependencies are available in `/opt` via the Lambda Layer.

### **Workflow Process**

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - The `Dockerfile` in the `layer/` folder creates the Lambda Layer zip.
   - The zip file is deployed alongside the Serverless configuration using GitHub Actions.

2. **Serverless Deployment**:
   - Serverless YAML deploys:
     - **S3 bucket**: To trigger the first Lambda.
     - **SQS queue**: To act as a message queue.
     - **Two Lambda functions**:
       - **S3-to-SQS** Lambda: Sends S3 event messages to SQS.
       - **SQS Processor** Lambda: Processes messages from SQS.

3. **Lambda Layer**:
   - Includes system libraries (`Tesseract`, `Poppler`) and Python dependencies (`unstructured`, `boto3`).
   - Attached to both Lambda functions during deployment.

This folder structure ensures that the **Dockerfile**, CI/CD pipeline, and Serverless configuration work together seamlessly. Let me know if you need further tweaks!
